# Interact with the FOLIO Stable VM

The previous lessons have provided a quick overview of deploying the parts of the system, and doing some minimal configuration.

This Lesson uses the folio-stable VM to provide a full up-to-date system.
It has all the necessary modules deployed, and users and items already loaded.

If you still have the VirtualBox guest running from the previous lessons, then change to the folio-curriculum directory and do `vagrant halt; cd ..`

# Start the folio-stable VM

Do this step prior to attending a workshop.

Prepare the box. It will site beside your other halted folio-curriculum box.

1. Make a clean directory and change into it: `mkdir folio-stable && cd folio-stable`
1. Set up the Vagrantfile: `vagrant init --minimal folio/stable`
1. Launch the VirtualBox guest: `vagrant up`
1. Connect to the VirtualBox guest: `vagrant ssh`

The [folio-ansible](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible) notes explain the purpose of the "stable" box, [show](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible/blob/master/doc/index.md) how to explore the system, view the Okapi logs and Stripes logs, and find the box version information and [release notes](https://app.vagrantup.com/folio/boxes/stable).

# Follow the log files

Open a couple of shell terminal windows to follow the Okapi and Stripes log files.

Following these log files is [explained](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible/blob/master/doc/index.md#viewing-the-okapi-log), as well as how to follow each backend module logs.

```shell
$ cd folio-stable
$ vagrant ssh
$ tail -f /var/log/folio/okapi/okapi.log
```

```shell
$ cd folio-stable
$ vagrant ssh
$ docker logs stripes_stripes_1 --follow
```

# Interact via web browser

`open http://localhost:3000`

Admin login: diku_admin/admin

View the "About" page near the top-left corner to see the current version information for the services and dependencies.

Browse and view the Users and Items sections.

# Interact via command-line

Open a couple of shell terminal windows to send requests.

Remember that the Okapi service is forwarded through port 9130, so we can interact with it using 'curl' from the host machine.

Save the following script as `run-basic.sh` in your work directory. It provides a basic interaction with Okapi. Expand it to do some other queries. See the [API docs](http://dev.folio.org/doc/api).

Then do `./run-basic.sh`

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Run some queries against a folio-stable VM.

OKAPIURL="http://localhost:9130"
CURL="curl -w\n -D - "
PATH_TMP="/tmp/folio-demo"

H_TENANT="-HX-Okapi-Tenant:diku"
H_JSON="-HContent-type:application/json"

echo "Ensure Okapi ..."
$CURL $OKAPIURL/_/proxy/tenants
STATUS=$?
if [ $STATUS != 0 ]; then
  echo "Cannot contact Okapi: $STATUS"
  exit
fi
echo

echo Doing login and getting token ...
cat >$PATH_TMP-login-credentials.json << END
{
  "userId": "diku_admin",
  "password": "admin"
}
END

$CURL $H_TENANT $H_JSON --progress-bar \
  -X POST \
  -d@$PATH_TMP-login-credentials.json \
  $OKAPIURL/authn/login > $PATH_TMP-login-response.json
H_TOKEN=-H`grep -i x-okapi-token "$PATH_TMP-login-response.json" | sed 's/ //' `

# echo Received a token $H_TOKEN
echo

echo Test 1: Find some users
$CURL $H_TENANT $H_TOKEN $OKAPIURL/users?query=personal.lastName=a*+sortBy+username
echo

echo Finished.
```
